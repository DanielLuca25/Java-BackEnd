The application is a Spring Boot-based system designed for the management of orders and products. It provides a set of RESTful APIs for handling CRUD operations related to orders and products.
The data for the products and orders are retrived from the sql database located in the resources file.
I've implemented get, post and delete functions, in the controller file, which can be tested using POSTMAN.
